I am working with a kernel module that has a few kconfig options associated
with it. The makefile for the module as it is does not support out-of-tree
builds. I am trying to change the the makefile to do out-of-tree builds.
Most of this is pretty straight forward, however I can't seem to find any
recomendations on to do local configurations for just the out of tree build.

right now I use the code below, but I don't realy think it is a good
solution because of the possible confilict between the local .config file
and the kernel .config file. Any suggestions on how I should handle this?



ifneq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
# kbuild part of makefile

# Optionally, include config file to allow out of tree kernel modules build
-include $(src)/.config

# Core module
obj-$(CONFIG_XXX)             += xxx.o
xxx-y                         += xxx-core.o xxx-sysfs.o

# drivers
obj-$(CONFIG_XXX_1)    += xxx1.o
obj-$(CONFIG_XXX_2)    += xxx2.o


else
# normal makefile
KDIR ?= /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

default: .config
        $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$$PWD modules

.config:
        @echo need local .config
        exit 1

modules_install:
        $(MAKE) -C $(KDIR) M=$$PWD modules_install


clean:
        rm -rf *.o *~ core .depend .*.cmd *.ko *.mod.c .tmp_versions \
               modules.order Module.symvers

endif

First, why do you want to build the module out-of-tree?

For 3rd party modules I can understand that need, OTOH, in that case your
question wouldn't have existed.

Cheers,
Anders

I am working with a third party module that I am building out of tree.? I trying this across multiple platforms.? I am placing the module code in our VCS... out of tree seems to be a cleaner, simpler, les complicated? solution to me.

Without? trying to sound confrontational, why not build it out of tree?

Why not have it build in-tree? That way you can throw it at Greg KH
and get it in (at least) drivers/staging, at which point you no longer
have to do ongoing maintenance to keep in sync with new kernel APIs - if
anybody changes an API that  you're using, it's their job to update
your use of it. :)

Well, from your first email, I got the impression that you tried to move an
in-tree module out of the kernel tree.

What 3rd party module is it that you're building, that is delivered to you
in a state to only allow in-tree builds? That's a pretty uncommon
situation.

Are the config options you need to be set something that only this module
knows about, or are they something the rest of the kernel knows about?

> Without  trying to sound confrontational, why not build it out of tree?

Well, there's nothing wrong to build a true 3rd party module out-of-tree.
It might very well be your only choice due to a number of factors.

Though, if you can get it upstreamed, you'll win in the long term.

Cheers,
Anders

I'm playing with a module off of github -? fbtft.?? All the config is local to the module.?

Thanks
